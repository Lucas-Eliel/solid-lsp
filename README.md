# Liskov Substitution Principle

### If for every object o1 of type S, there is an object o2 of type T, such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is not modified when o1 is replaced by o2, then S is a subtype of T

### Simplification: The derived classes should be replaceable by your base classes.
